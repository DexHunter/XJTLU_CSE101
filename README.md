## Solution to several homework, done by Dex D. Hunter 2016

This is my solution to the assignments. Feel free to ask me anything. I found a lot useful resources on stackoverflow and tested several different cases. 

Update(20/01/2017):

The final mark for both assignments of mine is 90. Altough I do not know they deduct my points, it is possible being caused by things I listsed below. Hope you all good luck on module CSE101.

##Possible improvement:

####Assignment 3
1. Read a string of numbers and check whether is odd or even, which could be done with int type easily using my approach, but since a string is read, we need to convert to number first.

2. Better use of memory

####Assignment 4

1. Handling of non-digit char

...

##Reminder

####If you are a XJTLU student, please solve the problem by yourself, this is for reference purpose only. Cheers.
